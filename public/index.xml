      <description>Introduction My name is Luke Green. I am a Software Engineer working at Therapy Brands with Fusion Web Clinic and Thera-LINK. All opinions are my own.
I am starting this blog as an exercise in learning more than anything, and if I can share some information along the way that is an added bonus. A blog will give me an excuse to collect my thoughts about things that I think are important, as well as hopefully receive feedback from others and hear new opinions.</description>
